# ☕ CaféGo – Coffee Ordering App (UI/UX Design)

This project was created as part of my **CodeAlpha UI/UX Internship**, focusing on designing a modern coffee ordering experience through Figma.

## 🧩 Task 1 – Low-Fidelity Wireframes
I began by designing low-fidelity wireframes to define the structure, layout, and flow of the app.  
The goal was to ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for users ordering coffee on the go.

### 🖼️ Included Screens
- Splash Screen  
- Login / Signup  
- Home (Menu Categories)  
- Coffee Details  
- Add to Queue
- Confirm Order 
- Checkout  

🛠️ *Tool:* Figma  
🎯 *Focus:* Information hierarchy, navigation, and wireflow clarity

## 🎨 Task 2 – High-Fidelity UI Design
Next, I transformed the wireframes into a visually appealing and user-friendly high-fidelity interface.

### 🎨 Design Highlights
- **Color Palette:** Shades of Brown (#5C4033), Cream (#F7EDE2), and Accent Orange (#D2691E)  
- **Typography:**  
  - Headings – *Poppins Bold*  
  - Body – *Roboto Regular*  
- **Theme:** Warm, cozy, and minimal aesthetic representing coffee culture  

🛠️ *Tool:* Figma  
🎯 *Focus:* Visual hierarchy, color psychology, consistency, and brand identity
